# ✈️ Flight Fare Predictor (Machine Learning)

 Live Demo](https://flight-fare-predictor-machine-learning.onrender.com/)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RahulRajGiri15/Flight-Fare-Predictor__Machine-Learning)

This web application predicts flight fares based on various input parameters such as airline, departure and arrival time, source, destination, duration, and number of stops. It uses a trained machine learning model to estimate prices, helping users plan their travel more efficiently.

##  Features

*  Predicts flight fare using real-time user inputs
*  Trained using regression algorithms on actual flight fare data
*  Clean and responsive web UI built with Flask
*  Deployed and accessible online via Render

---

##  Machine Learning Model
